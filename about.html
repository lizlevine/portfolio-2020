        <p>
          Hello! My name is Liz Levine, and I'm originally from Detroit,
          Michigan. I've been living in Manhattan since the 1980's when the city
          had a very different look and feel than it does today. I've have the
          priviledge and opportunity to explore many different career paths.
          <!-- and develop manyinterests and hobbies. I began working in publishing, then entered the
          fashion industry working in the luxury market sector buying, selling &
          merchandising. I spent more than a decade in the interior design
          industry collaborating with architects, designers, and project
          managers on commercial, hospitality and high end residential projects. -->
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Like many New Yorkers, I found the urban life all too demanding. This
          is when I took and interest in health and wellness and discovered my
          passion for the then unknown, Pilates Method. I was blessed to study
          directly under the renowned Romana Kryzanowska (the only living
          decendent and apprentice to Joseph Pilates).
        </p> -->
        <p>
          As an undergraduate, I briefly studied computer programming, which I
          loved and excelled at. I found the process of breaking down complex
          problems into a series of logical steps facinating and inspiring. At
          the time however, I could not see a path forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          Years later, while trading cryptocurrency, I redisovered this passion.
          While using different trading platforms, I learned how to enable
          greater functionality with charts and graphs through changing the code
          in their code editor. I also discovered an interest and apptitude for
          technical annalysis. It was then that I had my "ah-ha" moment and
          began my fact finding mission about what it takes to develop software.
          After much due dilligence, I discovered and was accepted into Columbia
          University's School of Engineering, full stack web development
          program.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of my many hours spent coding and brainstorming new apps, my
          favorite hobby is training and grooming my beloved two-year-old
          Basenji (pictured here as a 13-week-old puppy) for the show ring!
          Reiki comes from a long line of AKC Grand Champions and is following
          his ancestors's paw-steps, competing for his championship title.
        </p>
