          Hello! My name is Liz Levine, and I'm originally from Detroit,
          Michigan. I've been living in Manhattan since the 1980's when the city
          had a very different look and feel than it does today. I've have the
          priviledge to explore different career paths and develop many
          interests and hobbies. I began working in publishing, then entered the
          fashion industry working in the luxury market sector buying, selling &
          merchandising. I spent more than a decade in the interior design
          industry collaborating with architects, designers, and project
          managers on commercial, hospitality and high end residential projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many New Yorkers, I found the urban life all too demanding. This
          is when I took and interest in health and wellness and discovered my
          passion for the then unknown, Pilates Method. I was blessed to study
          directly under the renowned Romana Kryzanowska (the only living
          decendent and apprentice to Joseph Pilates).
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I spend much of my free time with Reiki, my beloved
          two-year-old Basenji who is pictured here as a 12-week-old puppy. He
          comes from a long line of AKC Grand Champions and is following in his
          ancestors's paw-steps, competing for his championship title. Much of
          my free time is spent training and grooming him for the show ring!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in learning more about the unique, exquisite, and
          ancient Basenji breed, please visit my (still-in-progress) "passion
          project" website
