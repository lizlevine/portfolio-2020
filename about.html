          Hello! My name is Liz Levine, and I'm originally from Detroit, Michigan. I've been living in Manhattan since the 1980's when the city had a very different look and feel than it does today. During this time, I've had the privilege and opportunity to explore many different career paths.
          <!-- and develop manyinterests and hobbies. I began working in publishing, then entered the
          fashion industry working in the luxury market sector buying, selling &
          merchandising. I spent more than a decade in the interior design
          industry collaborating with architects, designers, and project
          managers on commercial, hospitality and high end residential projects. -->
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Like many New Yorkers, I found the urban life all too demanding. This
          is when I took and interest in health and wellness and discovered my
          passion for the then unknown, Pilates Method. I was blessed to study
          directly under the renowned Romana Kryzanowska (the only living
          decendent and apprentice to Joseph Pilates).
        </p> -->
        <p>
          As an undergraduate, I briefly studied computer programming, which I loved and excelled at. I found the process of breaking down complex problems into a series of logical steps fascinating and inspiring. Yet, at the time, I could not see a path forward

        <p>
          Years later, while trading cryptocurrency, I rediscovered this passion. While using different trading platforms, I learned how to enable greater functionality by editing source code. I was able to study market trends and analyze moving averages. During this process, I discovered an interest and aptitude for technical analysis. It was then that I had my "ah-ha" moment and began a fact-finding mission about what's required to develop software. After much due diligence, I discovered and was accepted into Columbia University's School of Engineering, full-stack software engineering program.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of the many hours spent coding and brainstorming new apps, my favorite hobby is training and grooming my beloved three-year-old Basenji (pictured here as a 13-week-old puppy) for the show ring! Reiki comes from a long line of AKC Grand Champions and is following his ancestors' paw-steps, competing for his championship title.
